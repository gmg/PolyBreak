PolyBreak
by Gwyn Perry

This is a learning exercise in Polycode Lua. Most of it has been built 
through trial and error, and is probably wrong. It will be updated as 
I learn more about the framework and get a better understanding of how 
it all works. My hope is that it will be able to serve as a complete 
example project that others can learn from, demonstrating the use of 
a wide range of Polycode features in a realistic setting.

To Do:
* Ball-Brick collision response
* Ball-Paddle collision response
* Loss condition (last ball off screen)
* Level completion condition (count remaining destroyable bricks)
* Level loading (need external file loader & parsing)
* Enhancements to gameplay (power-ups, bonuses)
* Image sprites for all objects
* Sound effects
* Menus, screens & flow
* Scoring and HUD
